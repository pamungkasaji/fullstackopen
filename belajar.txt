[ PART 1 ]
c. Component state, event handlers
   Complex state
      const [clicks, setClicks] = useState({
         left: 0, right: 0
      })
      const handleLeftClick = () =>
         setClicks({ ...clicks, left: clicks.left + 1 })
   Handling arrays state
      const [allClicks, setAll] = useState([])
      setAll(allClicks.concat('L'))
   Conditional rendering
   Old React
      we use the state hook to add state to our React components
      Before the addition of hooks, there was no way to add state to functional components
   Debugging React applications
      Keep the browser's developer console open at all times.
      add the React developer tools extension to add Components tab
   Rules of Hooks
      useState function and useEffect must not be called from inside of a loop, a conditional expression, or any place that is not a function defining a component
      hooks may only be called from the inside of a function body that defines a React component
   Event Handling Revisited
   Function that returns a function
      //state
      const [value, setValue] = useState(10)
      //the function
      const setToValue = (newValue) => () => {
         setValue(newValue)   }
      //event handler
      <button onClick={setToValue(0)}>reset</button>
   Passing Event Handlers to Child Components
      for example, by extracting the button into its own component
         <button onClick={props.handleClick}>   {props.text}   </button>
   Do Not Define Components Within Components
      The application still appears to work, but never define components inside of other components
	Useful Reading
   Excercise
      nice excercise
   
   Calling a function which changes the state causes the component to rerender.

A more complex state, debugging React apps
	Do Not Define Components Within Components

Part 2
a Rendering a collection, modules
	JavaScript Arrays = find, filter, and map
b. Forms

d.
  A React component defines the HTML, the JavaScript functions, and also the component's styling; all in one place
